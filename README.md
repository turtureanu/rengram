# **r**eassembled **engram** (rengram)

Rengram is a keyboard layout made for people who want to use the [Engram](https://engram.dev/) keyboard layout by rearraging already existing keys from a QWERTY US layout (or similar). It does this by keeping the number row intact with a slight modification regarding the placement of parantheses, square brackets, and curly braces: those are placed at the end of the number row.

I also included a Czech variant of the rengram layout for personal use.

Makefile based of off https://github.com/tonyaldon/keyboard-layout/blob/master/Makefile and https://github.com/binarybottle/engram/blob/master/install/linux/x_keyboard_extension/Makefile.
